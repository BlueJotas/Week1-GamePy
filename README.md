# Creating an Encrypter/Decrypter

**Encrypter based on Cipher encryption algorithm**


*This program will show you how a message can be encrypted and decrypted using*
*only two parameters: A message that you want to encode and a key which will*
*be necessary to the process and a information that you must have in order to*
*decrypt the message and discover the original message.*
**Without it you won't be able to read anything that makes sense!**
*The code is full of information which will guide you throughout the process*
*of the encryption/decryption of the message!*
*Good luck and enjoy playing with it!*
